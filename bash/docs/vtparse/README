VTParse - an implementation of Paul Williams' DEC compatible state machine parser

This code is in the public domain.

BUILDING
========

Ruby is required at build time to generate the tables in C.  To build the library
and test program, just type make:

$ make
ruby vtparse_gen_c_tables.rb
Wrote vtparse_table.h
Wrote vtparse_table.c
gcc -o test vtparse_test.c vtparse.c vtparse_table.c

TEST PROGRAM
============

The test program shows how to use vtparse.  To see what kind of data is returned
by the library, try:

--------------------------------

$ vim > terminaloutput
<type ':q<ENTER>' to exit vim, even though you won't see it>
$ ./test < terminaloutput  | head -14
Received action ESC_DISPATCH, char=0x37
Intermediate chars: ''
0 Parameters:

Received action CSI_DISPATCH, char=0x68
Intermediate chars: '???'
1 Parameters:
        47

Received action CSI_DISPATCH, char=0x68
Intermediate chars: '???'
1 Parameters:
        1

---------------------------------

VERIFYING
=========

You can also verify the validity of the state tables by running:

$ ruby vtparse_check_tables.rb
Tables had all necessary transitions defined.

This checks to make sure that state transitions are defined for all states, for all
characters 0-0xA0.


TODO
====

One possible enhancement is to allow the client to pass a return value from the
callback to say "stop parsing."  The vtparse() function could return the number
of bytes consumed from the input buffer.  This would be quite simple to do if
someone needed this functionality, but I don't, so I didn't bother.
